# TypeScript compile API Transform Sample

TypeScript compile API (`tsc`) offers `transform` to apply AST transformation. Hope this repo will help you to write your own transform. You may want to check [microsoft/TypeScript-wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-wiki/blob/master/Using-the-Compiler-API.md) to see more API explanation.

## Develop

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start` to run the sample code.

Edit and debug `src/transform-interface.ts` to see the code. If you're using VS Code, F5 debug is setup already.
